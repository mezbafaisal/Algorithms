Binary search is a fast algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half:
1. Compare the target to the middle element.
2. If it matches, return the index.
3. If the target is smaller, search the left half.
4. If larger, search the right half.
5. Repeat until found or range is empty.

Time complexity: O(log n).

Here's a quick example:

Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] Target: 7

1. Start with the middle element: 5.
   Target 7 > 5, search the right half: [7, 9].

2. Middle element is now 7.
   Target matches! Return index 3.

Binary search finds 7 at index 3.
