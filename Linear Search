Linear search checks each element in a list one by one until it finds the target or reaches the end. 
It's simple but not efficient for large lists. 
Time complexity: O(n).

def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i  # Return the index if found
    return -1  # Return -1 if not found

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
target = 30
result = linear_search(arr, target)
print(result)  # Output: 2 (index of 30 in the array)
