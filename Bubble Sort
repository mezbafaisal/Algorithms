Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Example of Bubble Sort on the list [5, 3, 8, 1]:

1. Compare 5 and 3: Swap → [3, 5, 8, 1]
2. Compare 5 and 8: No swap → [3, 5, 8, 1]
3. Compare 8 and 1: Swap → [3, 5, 1, 8]

Repeat the process:
1. Compare 3 and 5: No swap → [3, 5, 1, 8]
2. Compare 5 and 1: Swap → [3, 1, 5, 8]

Repeat again:
1. Compare 3 and 1: Swap → [1, 3, 5, 8]
List is sorted.
